              Cryptocurrency is a form of digital or virtual money secured by cryptography and built on a technology called blockchain, which records and verifies transactions across a distributed network of computers.

                In 2008, an anonymous person introduced a new form of money into the market. Because it's decentralized and not issued by any single government or central authority, cryptocurrency lets people send money directly to each other without intermediaries like banks.

                Like all investments, this site is not guaranteeing any success because cryptocurrencies also face drawbacks: their prices can swing widely, mining and transaction validation can consume a lot of energy, and because transactions can be pseudonymous, some cryptocurrencies have been used for illicit activities.
