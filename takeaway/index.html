        <p>
            <strong>What have we done so far?</strong><br><br>
            So far, we have collected and cleaned multiple cryptocurrency datasets and built a webpage that displays all three visualizations. 
            We created an interactive rate-of-change tool that lets users drag or resize a time window to instantly see percentage changes across different assets. 
            We also added a D3 line chart to show long-term price movements and a normalized trend visualization to highlight comparisons across coins. 
            The webpage structure and layout are in place, so users can already explore the data in meaningful ways.
        </p>

            <strong>What will be the most challenging part of our project to design and why?</strong><br><br>
            The most challenging part of our project will be dealing with the complexity of the crypto datasets themselves. 
            Because each coin behaves differently and has its own level of volatility, it can be difficult to create visualizations that highlight meaningful patterns without overwhelming the viewer. 
            Another challenge is ensuring that the interactive and static visuals work smoothly together so users can explore the data without confusion. 
            We also need to think about how to explain trends in a way that feels intuitive, since crypto price movements are often fast, noisy, and unpredictable. 
            Overall, the hardest part will be turning messy, high-volume time-series data into something clean, readable, and genuinely meaningful for users.
