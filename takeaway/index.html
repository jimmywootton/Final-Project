            <p>
                Cryptocurrency is a difficult market to join. While like any market where it has its large ups and downs, we offer this site as a way to help 
                jumpstart into the world of crypto investing. With our interactive visualization, users can explore the price changes of various cryptocurrencies over time,
                while keeping it simple with imagery without sacraficing too much knowledge with the use of the tooltip. The team hopes that by the end of this exercise,
                users will feel more comfortable with their future investment decisions as well as feel more educated in this market.
